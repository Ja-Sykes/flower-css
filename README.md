# flower-css
I know CSS but want to become better at it. Nothing crazy. I want to learn CSS animations, maybe with the help of Javascript later on with all of its libraries.I often use bootstrap, looking forward to learning Tailwind CSS sometime soon. This flower is nothing to boast about, but I am proud of it regardless.
